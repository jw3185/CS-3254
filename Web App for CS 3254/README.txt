-------------------------------------------------
templates folder contains four html files

One is for the main page called index, this page is mostly made up of forms
and two submit buttons and allows users to either login or create an account.

signUp.html is used when someone successfully creates a new account on the site, 
it displays the information entered into the forms and states that the account 
was created successfully

userHome.html is used to represent what the user sees when they login in 
(currently not functional, its static and generic for all users)

login.html links to userHome if login was successful

styleForMainIndex.css, not used for anything yet may or may not be used in future
along with additional css files
